						Tragedy was initially described by Aristotle as a heightened tale of an exalted hero and his
						fall from grace due to a tragic flaw and even in simpler terms by Chaucer as a tale written in
						prosperity of a time that ended in wretchedness.Whether tragedy or the 'wretchedness' is due to
						the tragic flaw in the character or simply unreasonable fate that determines an inevitable end
						is an unanswered perplexity.The question of culpability over the tragic events unfolding in the
						play Macbeth js quite as complex as the concept of tragedy itself.The blame can not be crowned
						on a single character even if he/she was either; the perpetrator, or the driving force ,or even
						the external elements that led to the determinate end. </p>
					<p>
						Macbeth is first presented to us as a fearless general vicious but loyal.He ' unseamed'
						Macdonwald 'from the nave to th' chops' and fixed his head upon the battlement displaying his
						ease with violence.He even seems to greet the fog and filthy air as if in expectation of the
						supernatural manifestation.He starts in fear but not in surprise, as if his deep dark secrets
						were thrown in sharp relief by the malicious apparition that did speak of things 'so fair'.He is
						enraptured with the the possibilities and his soul appears to us as divided in three raging
						battles, one with himself and the 'horrible imaginings ' or regicide by the once loyal subject,
						the other somewhat galvanised into making his long kept desire come true and the third a timid
						practical sense that said ' If chance will have me king, why, chance may crown me </p>
					<p>
						Without my stir' even though he is still desirous of the crown.This battle might have been
						inflamed in him for long possibly suggested by the first witche's 'When the battle’s lost and
						won'.In this play where nothing appears simple,no statement given forthright,the battle
						obviously won against Macdonwald and the traitor could not be the one referenced here.

					</p>
					<p>
						One decided aspect is certainly established with Macbeth's first encounter with the witches.The
						prophecy might have come through them since they 'have more than mortal knowledge ' , but the
						notion was not original.It is futher solidified by Macbeth's reaction at King Duncan announcing
						his son Malcom as the next heir and the Prince of Cumberland.He immediately decides ,'That is a
						step

						On which I must fall down, or else o'erleap/For in my way it lies'.His ambition of imperial
						dominance has been which he ' esteem’st the ornament of life' as later ruthlessly suggested by
						Lady Macbeth.

					</p>
					<p>
						Therefore , I feel to adorn the wreath of culpability on Lady Macbeth alone even does not rest
						the matter.Although she was his 'dearest partner in greatness', she was 'transported beyond the
						ignorant present ' after receiving his letter that spoke of the 'perfect report'.She as a
						devoted wife aware of his ambition since she mentions that he was the one to 'break the
						enterprise to her' at a time when 'Nor time nor place/Did then adhere, and yet you make both'
						(1.7).And made of a tenacious nature she resolves to ensure his ambition does realise.She was
						indeed at one point the 'temptress' greeting Macbeth when he first comes to her quite similarly
						to the witches, who themselves were the cause of rekindling Macbeth's desires.
					</p>
					<p>
						Also, the soliloquy where she summons the 'spirits'; as if sacrificing her soul to the devil in
						return for what her heart or her husband's heart desired , to 'unsex her' and to fill her from
						top to toe of 'direst cruelty'.This fascinating and demonic display of character does make her
						out to be the 'fiend-like queen' Macduff dubs her to be later in the play and indeed she was the
						impetus Macbeth needed to commit a most cruel,immoral and unholy act of murder of not only a
						guest but the monarch.She challenges his manhood, ' Be so much more the man' and appears the
						dominant will here.Unfortunately, her foresight into her own nature and of the consequences of
						her will fall short of her will.She instantly panicks as she hears the bell 'Alack, I am afraid
						they have awaked, And ’tis not done/ Th' attempt and not the deed Confounds us'.It was
